## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to showcase a search functionality applied to a table containing random data. The user can input text in the search bar, and the table dynamically filters the content based on the input.

## Usage

To use the application, simply visit the [hosted link](https://shah9380.github.io/search_tabledata/) and interact with the search bar. You can input the name or country to filter the table data accordingly.

## Features

- Dynamic table filtering based on user input.
- Random data generation for the table.
- Responsive search functionality.

## Technologies Used

This project primarily uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following key JavaScript elements and functions were used:

- **Event Listeners**: Used to track user input in the search bar and trigger table updates.
- **Array.filter()**: Applied to filter the data based on user input.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Utilized to create and update table content dynamically.
- **Promises**: Employed to ensure smooth rendering and updates when the table data changes.
